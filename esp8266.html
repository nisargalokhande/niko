       <p><b>What is ESP 8266? <br>           </b>
           ESP8266 is a wifi SOC (system on a chip) produced by Espressif Systems . It is an highly integrated chip designed to provide full internet 
           connectivity in a small package. We xan also use it for Haking purpose to by it we can Jam Wifi Signal.<br><br>          </p>
       <p><b>Technical Features of Esp 8266            </b>  
       <br>Wi-Fi Direct (P2P), soft-AP<br>

       <br><br>
       <b>Variants</b>
       <br>
       ESP8266-based boards are available from several vendors and with different breakout boards. Most of the boards differ in the number of pins made availabl
       the amount of Flash memory for storing program and data, and the shielding on the SOC for certified boards.
       <br>
       Some boards also support an external uFL antenna connector as well as the buil-in on-chip antenna.
       <br>
       The most common variants are:
       <br>1.ESP-01
       <br>2.ESP-03

       <br><b>What are it's uses?</b>
       ESP8266 can be used as an external Wifi module, using the standard AT Command set Firmware by connecting it to any microcontroller using the serial UART, 
       or directly serve as a Wifi-enabled micro controller, by programming a new firmware using the provided SDK.
       The GPIO pins allow Analog and Digital IO, plus PWM, SPI, I2C, etc.
       <br>
       This board has been around for almost a year now, and has been used mostly in IoT contexts, where we want to add connectivity for example to an Arduino project.
        A wide adoption has been facilitated by the very modest price, ranging from 2.50 to 10 USD depending on the features offered by the manufacturers.
        <br> <br>
