            Smart home technology streamlines and enhances plenty of parts of life. One particularly impacted area is security, which benefits significantly from remote access, cloud storage, and encrypted authentication (AKA private keys). Low-cost security cameras and versatile video doorbells get a lot of press, but smart locks can also make your life significantly easier while providing powerful peace of mind.

            <br>When looking for a smart lock, one of the first things to consider is which smart assistant you want it to integrate with. All smart locks worth their salt support one of the three most popular ecosystems, including Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. It's important to confirm which one your lock of choice supports and whether it requires a standalone hub to unlock all its capabilities. We've taken out the guesswork with the best smart locks you can get right now.

            <br><br>Other essential features to consider are keypads, fingerprint access, and the ability to assign personal keys to guests or short-term vacation renters. These features, plus ease of installation, battery life, connectivity strength, and fit and finish, help some smart locks to stand out quite a bit from the rest.
            <br><br><br>1. August 4th Generation
            <br><br>One of the first reasons to consider August Smart Lock is that you can retrofit it to most deadbolts with minimal modification. Not only is it easy to install, but the 4th-generation model is also even smaller than its already compact predecessors. You won't have to deal with a bulky and unsightly addition to the inside of your door. Another improvement compared to older models is that this one finally has the Wi-Fi bridge built-in, eliminating the need for a separate device.

            <br><br>Once it's installed and configured, you can use Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri to issue simple voice commands or activate preset routines and automation. August also offers geolocation-based auto-locking and unlocking, so you don't have to search for your keys. Finally, you can access all those features, and assign multiple guest keys, without additional payments or any kind of subscription. We typically balk at smart home devices that require ongoing payments to access their most helpful features, so August's all-in approach earns its latest smart lock our Editor's Choice selection.

            <br><br>2. Google Nest X Yale
            <br>One of the hallmarks of the entire Nest ecosystem is that its devices and app are about as streamlined as anything else on the market. So, if yours is one of the many households invested in many Nest products, the Nest x Yale smart lock will fit right in. As it's clearly endorsed by Google, the owners of the Nest family of products, it's no surprise that you can access most of its features with Google Assistant voice controls. This includes simple tasks like checking whether it's locked, locking or unlocking it, and activating custom Google Routines.

            <br>As you might imagine, though, Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa users are out of luck. It's also worth noting that many of its best features — including in-depth remote access — require the Google Nest Hub, but anybody who loves the Nest family, in general, is probably already using one.

            <br>SPECIFICATIONS
            <br>Connectivity: Wi-Fi, with bridge
            <br>Integrations: Google Assistant
            <br>Keypad: Yes
            <br>Hub Required: Yes, for remote access
            <br>PROS
            <br>Simple yet stylish design
            <br>User-friendly app experience
            <br>CONS
            <br>Smart functions require the Wi-Fi bridge
            <br>Exclusively for the Google Nest ecosystem

            <br><br>3. Wyze Lock
            <br>Not being particularly advanced is one of the strengths of the affordable Wyze Lock. You can install it without replacing your current deadbolt, which means you won't be advertising to the world that you have a new smart lock. Plus, you can continue to use your old keys. It's compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, and you can use either to lock, unlock, or check its current status. It does require you to use a hub to connect to your home Wi-Fi network.

            <br>While the hub is included, it will take up an empty AC outlet, which can be slightly inconvenient. Unfortunately, while you can link it to several automations in conjunction with other Wyze smart devices, it's not compatible with almost any third-party smart home electronics.

            <br>SPECIFICATIONS
            <br>Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
            <br>Integrations: Alexa, Google Assistant
            <br>Keypad: Optional
            <br>Hub Required: Yes, but it's included
            <br>PROS
            <br>Simple installation
            <br>Looks like a normal door lock
            <br>Costs relatively little
            <br>Doesn't make much noise
            <br>CONS
            <br>Inconsistent auto-unlock feature
            <br>No Apple HomeKit support

            <br><br><br><br><br>4. Kwikset Halo

            <br>All the wireless connectivity hardware is contained within the unit, so you won't need to plug in a hub anywhere else. It does offer extensive remote management capabilities that let you set up 250 different codes and assign full-time, limited, or one-time use status to each. If you're looking for something dependable but not fancy, the Halo's a great option.

            <br>SPECIFICATIONS
            <br>Connectivity: Wi-Fi
            <br>Integrations: Alexa, Google Assistant
            <br>Keypad: No
            <br>Hub Required: No
            <br>PROS
            <br>Responds to commands quickly
            <br>Includes replacement deadbolt and keys
            <br>Integrated Wi-fi radio
            <br>CONS
            <br>Lacks proximity-based auto-unlocking

            <br><br><br><br>5. Schlage Encode
            <br>From electronics to the physical deadbolt and a fresh set of keys, the Schlage Encode comes with everything needed to upgrade to a premium smart lock. You can use Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa for relatively straightforward control. Like most of our favorite smart home products, the Encode gets high marks for its user-friendly app and its versatile control options. It comes standard with an integrated keypad and an alarm that alerts you to physical tampering.

            <br>You can use voice control to check if it's unlocked and lock it and use any pre-configured Google Routines you might have in place, including locking or unlocking the door. The main drawback to the Encode right now is that it's tough to find at a reasonable price. With that in mind, keep an eye out for the Schlage Encode Plus, which should be readily available soon. Once it is, we'll have the definitive word for you on whether it's worth the upgrade.
