            iPhones are always the centre of attention whenever there is a new announcement or a launch. Users across the world look forward to the new devices that the company has to offer. The latest offering from the company is the iPhone SE 3 5G. The smaller, and more economic version of Apple flagship smartphones, is launched. Multiple critics follow the launch, highlighting the obsolete design, form factor, and size. However, among the many criticisms that the phone is receiving, there are some good aspects about it too. This article will be about the updated camera on the phone. Apple has been famous for the technology they use in their cameras. The iPhone SE 3 5G being the newest addition to the smartphone line-up, there are some expectations from the phone.

            iPhone SE 3 5G Camera Specifications
            The design of the camera module in the iPhone SE 3 5G is the one seen on the iPhone 8. The hardware of the entire camera setup of the phone has been taken from the iPhone 8. However, this does not imply that the camera is outdated. With the presence of the new A15 Bionic chip, Apple has improved the camera for good.
            <br>
            <br>
            The iPhone SE 3 5G comes with a single camera setup with one primary 12-megapixel lens of f/1.8 aperture accompanied by a 7-megapixel shooter in the front for selfies. This does not look very impressive or competitive on paper, but with the help of its processing power and software, Apple compensates for the hardware of the past. The A15 Bionic chip brings in Smart HDR4 and deep fusion to iPhone SE 3. With fast focus, close to accurate colors, and a decent dynamic range, the camera on the phone does not look bad.
            <br>
            The 7-megapixel front camera is exhibiting the limitations of the hardware. One can still take good photos under day-light and well-lit conditions, but when the surroundings are contrasty or dimly lit, the camera might not be very impressive. Adding to that, none of the cameras supports ultra-wide angles or any other mode. This takes away the versatility factor from the iPhone SE 3 when the competition in the market is considered.

            The camera functions well in most conditions but might struggle a little under artificial lighting or low-light conditions. Some images can even look flushed out, but this is not recurring. The camera performs well and can help you get some good shots. For more such articles and samples, keep an eye on Niko,
