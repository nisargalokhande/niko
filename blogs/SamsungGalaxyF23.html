          <h2>Samsung Galaxy F23 5G Camera Review with Samples</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Samsung has been making some big changes to their mid-range line-up. These smartphones include the M-series and the F-series line-up that are primarily available in the online market. The latest addition to this line-up is the Samsung Galaxy F23 5G. The smartphone launched in the Indian market earlier this month.
            <br>
            The Galaxy F23 5G shares a lot of similarities in the looks department with the flagship Galaxy S22. The polycarbonate back of the phone gives a matte finish, and accompanies the camera module.

            <br>
            The Galaxy F23 5G houses a triple-camera module with a primary lens of 50-megapixel with an f/1.8 aperture. This is accompanied by the 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. The front camera is an 8-megapixel shooter. Certain changes have been made to the camera app as well. There are plenty of shooting options and modes that are mainly seen on the flagship series phones from Samsung.
            <br>
            “Single Take” can now be used on this phone, along with the newest addition of the “fun” shooting mode. The new mode lets you add filters on your front as well as the rear camera.

            <br>
            During the daytime, the primary camera did a good job with normal and close-up shots. On the other hand, if you are in dim indoor lighting conditions, the colours might seem pale and washed out. The ultra-wide can be a better alternative in these scenarios, however, the details can be a bit blurry.
            <br>
            If you are a low-light photographer, this camera set-up might not be for you. The performance has definitely improved from the last generation Galaxy F22, but the camera still struggles in low-light. Night mode also did not help improve the details, but it did fix the exposure on light sources. The ultra-wide camera can give you a good performance, but only under well lit circumstances.
            <br>
            The selfie camera on the phone also performs well in daylight. The skin tones and the details look prominent, and the images do not look oversaturated. One needs to be extremely steady when taking selfies in low-light in order to retain some details in the photo.
            <br>
            You can also shoot videos at up to 4K on the Galaxy F23 5G, but there is no stabilisation with this resolution. Video quality was good under daylight, but was above average in low light. At 1080p, the stabilisation works better, and you can also shoot while running or from a moving vehicle. Switching between cameras is also possible in this resolution. The low-light  performance is still not up to the mark.
