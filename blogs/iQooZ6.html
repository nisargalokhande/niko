            iQoo has been making some major advancements in its smartphones. The company recently launched its 9 and 9 Pro models. These phones were flagship and had the top of the line specifications. However, one aspect that stood out about both these phones was the camera. All the cameras on these phones performed well and gave us some very good shots to look at. The iQoo 9 and 9 Pro are the flagship models, but we also got our hands on the more budget-friendly offering of the company, the iQoo Z6 is a budget smartphone. iQoo is a sub-brand of Vivo, and Vivo has been making some serious advancements and innovations in its camera technology. It was interesting to see what kind of changes have been made to the more affordable options.

            iQoo Z6 Camera Specifications
            <br>
            On the optical front, the iQoo Z6 comes with a rear-camera module housing two lenses. One of them is the primary 50-megapixel shooter, with an f/1.8 aperture. This is next to the 2-megapixel macro shooter, and a 2-megapixel bokeh lens. In the front, one can see the 16-megapixel lens with f/2.0 aperture. The 50-megapixel eye autofocus helps in getting clearer and crisper images. If you want to click images while moving or running, this can be done very easily too, with the help of the eye autofocus feature.

            iQoo Z6 Camera Samples
            <br>
            These were the camera samples of the newly launched iQoo Z6, the performance looks good. The outdoor shots from the primary camera are vibrant, accurately coloured to an extent. The ultra-wide performance does not compromise on the colours and details, but it could be better. The camera performs well in low-light conditions too. The selfie camera produces good quality images, and it is also a good option for taking calls and video conferencing.
