            We know that modeling for 3D printing can be confusing: in 3D modeling, as in 3D printing, there is no one size fits all approach. We all use different software, print in different materials, and not only use different printers but also different printing technologies. So it’s perfectly normal to feel lost and it can sometimes seem difficult to design a perfect 3D model for 3D printing.
            <br>

That’s why we’ve put together the ultimate list of mistakes to avoid when turning a 3D model into a 3D print.\\

<br>

1. Ignoring Material Guidelines<br>
Each and every printing material is different.<br>
can be brittle or strong, flexible or solid, smoo<br>th or rough, heavy or light, and so on. This also means that an object should ideally be designed for a specific material. For example, if you know that you want to print your 3D model in
<br>
here will be specific material-related design r<br>ecommendations that you need to take into account such as supporting overhanging parts, strengthening elements that are sticking out, rounding off corners, etc.
<br>
Solution: Sticking to the design rules of your m<br>aterial is essential for a successful print. Ideally, you should read the design guides before you start to work on your model. 

2. Ignoring Printing Technology
It’s not only the basic chemical characteris<br>tics of our printing materials that are different, but also the technologies that are used for printing each of these materials.The reason behind this is not the material itself, but the technology that is used for printing each of these materials.

3. Ignoring Wall Thickness<br>
Even though you can find information about <br>the wall thickness in the guidelines that were already mentioned, it’s worth stressing this point again.

Problems linked to wall thickness are by<br> far the most common reasons why some 3D models are not printable. In some cases, wall thickness is too thin. Walls that are too thin make small parts on the model unable to be printed or very fragile and could break off easily. In other cases, walls that are too thick generate too much internal stress and could cause the item to crack or even break
<br>
4. Ignoring File Resolution<br>
For 3D printing, the most common file format is STL (which stands for standard triangle language), which means that your design will be translated into triangles in a 3D space. Most 3D modeling software has the option to export your designs to an STL file and set the desired resolution
<br>
Low-resolution STL file: It’s important to be aware that a poor-quality export will never allow us to provide you with a good print. Low-resolution means that the triangles in your STL file are big and the surface of your print will not be smooth. It will lead to a somewhat “pixelated” print.
Very high-resolution STL file: A file <br>with a resolution that is too high will make your file too big and sometimes impossible for us to handle. It might also contain an extreme level of detail that the 3D printers simply cannot print. That’s why we ask you to stay below a file size of 100 MB when uploading your model to our website.
<br>
Solution: In most 3D modeling software, when exporting a file you will be asked to define the tolerance for the export. This tolerance is defined as the maximum distance between the original shape and the STL mesh you are exporting. We advise choosing 0.01 mm for a good export.
<br>
5. Ignoring Software Guidelines<br>
Our community uses many different 3D modeling software packages. Some were designed for creating 3D prints, others are mostly used by 3D artists and their designs will require additional editing before they can offer a printable 3D model. For example, applying a wall thickness is automatic in some programs, while you must manually set it in others.
