            One of the best things about Android gaming is that it's portable, you can play wherever you want. The trouble with this setup is that many games require an internet connection to play them. Well, that stinks, so we here at Android Police have compiled a list of the best Android games that are fully offline, titles that are perfect for your daily commutes or summer trips. So if you're sick of your games asking you to connect to the internet just to play them, today's roundup is for you.

            <br>Dead Cells
            <br>Dead Cells is easily one of the best roguelike platformers available on the Play Store. Hands-down, the Android port is absolutely fantastic. You can select from 30FPS, 60FPS, and unlimited FPS in the game's settings, and there's also an HD graphics option for everyone with a beefy device. Personally, I've spent a lot of time playing this roguelike on Android, and I can confidently say the game runs like butter at max settings on high-end hardware. While this is a title that demands precision controls, it's fully playable with the touchscreen as well as a physical controller.
            <br>Grand Mountain Adventure
            <br>Winter sports games used to be highly popular back in the PS1/PS2 days, but it would seem the genre has fallen by the wayside in recent years, with only Ubisoft carrying the AAA mantle. Thankfully, Toppluva AB saw fit to create one of the best winter sports games in recent memory, and even though it's a mobile game, it's jampacked with content that can all be played offline.

            <br>'s a total of seven open-world mountains to explore, adding up to over 100+ challenges spread across these maps. You can ski, you can snowboard, and controller support is included. There's even a free-play zen mode for those who just want to hit the slopes. All around, it's a great game that shouldn't be missed, especially if you're a huge Coolboarders/SSX fan.

            <br>Super Hexagon
            <br>If you enjoy highly challenging arcade-style games, you're in luck; Super Hexagon fits that description perfectly, and seeing that it has been updated with high framerate support along with controller support, it's a standout release that's pretty old but still supported. Plus, as you would expect, the entire thing can be played offline, making it a perfect title for commuters, thanks to its bite-sized play.

            <br>Sessions tend to be quick and failure is a constant, but there is surely something incredibly fun about trying again and again to master the game's simple rules and fast motion.
            <br>
            <br>For $3, you can't go wrong.
            <br>Stardew Valley
            <br>Stardew Valley is a farming and life simulator, a seemingly niche genre with a dedicated fanbase. If you remember having fun with titles like Harvest Moon in the past, this has similar (but more wide-ranging) gameplay â€” no spoilers. The point being you can easily spend hundreds of hours playing, with lots of replayability.

            <br>Sure, things start simple enough by planting a few crops and maybe raising a chicken or two, and that's great if you prefer to play at a casual pace. Then again, if you're really looking for a game with some depth, not to mention an endless campaign, then Stardew Valley is easily my top choice in today's roundup, especially since the game supports gamepads. So not only is this a fun game to play with touch controls on a phone casually, you can really dig in on tablets and Chromebooks while out and about thanks to the included controller support and no requirement for an internet connection.
            <br>Civilization VI - Build A City | Strategy 4X Game
            <br>Aspyr media finally brought its mobile port for Civilization VI to Android in 2020. It came as a surprise, but it was definitely a welcome one. As you would expect, Civilization VI is a demanding game, with a map full of units, territories, cities, and AI players feeding a constantly growing simulation. That means performance can dip late-game, especially when it comes to loading times.

            <br>Keep in mind the title even chugs on the latest iPad Pro as well as the Nintendo Switch, so dropped frames are pretty much expected. Still, the Android version is an absolute joy to play despite some minor issues, and thanks to the 60-move free trial, everyone can test the game to see how it performs on their device before spending a dime. All around, this is a solid port from Aspyr Media, and it's an absolute blast to play on larger screens such as tablets. Best of all, since you don't need an internet connection to play, it's perfect for portable sessions.
            <br>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
            <br>Konami's classic Metroidvania title Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was released on the Play Store to everyone's surprise back in 2020, and it's available for $2.99, which is an absolute bargain. If you've yet to play SotN, it's a beautiful 2D platformer that offers non-linear gameplay, meaning exploration is encouraged.

            <br>The primary campaign should take about eight or nine hours to finish, so it will take much more than one sitting to work your way through this release, and since you can play offline, you won't have to worry about an internet connection once the game is installed.
            <br>GRID Autosport
            <br>GRID Autosport is a console-quality racer that landed on Android in 2019. The full game can be had for $10, and there are no IAPs or ads, which makes this a premium release. If you've yet to play this racer, it mixes many racing styles, from dirt tracks to city streets, and there are numerous distinct cars to race in. In comparison, most racers on Android are free-to-play, so they contain many questionable monetization systems and a requirement for a constant internet connection.
            <br>
            <br>If you've been searching for a premium mobile racer that won't break the bank, can be played offline anytime you want, and offers controller support out of the box, GRID Autosport is currently the best racer available on the Play Store that fits these requirements.
