            South Indian movies have been really making the headlines for the past few years. Though the South Indian industry in the last year and the year before that went through troubled times due to the COVID pandemic, as did the rest of the world. Things are beginning to get better. I think it is making one of the best movies in the country with the perfect balance of thought-provoking plot and the mainstream elements. After going through a disaster year that was 2021, the industry, with some blockbusters already under their belts, is slowly finding its ground. Here are the best South Indian movies of 2022 so far.
