            Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, a Java integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its code editing and developer tools
            <br>
            <br>
            To support application development within the Android operating system, Android Studio uses a Gradle-based build system, emulator, code templates, and Github integration. Every project in Android Studio has one or more modalities with source code and resource files. These modalities include Android app modules, Library modules, and Google App Engine modules.
            <br>
            <br>
            Android Studio uses an Instant Push feature to push code and resource changes to a running application. A code editor assists the developer with writing code and offering code completion, refraction, and analysis. Applications built in Android Studio are then compiled into the APK format for submission to the Google Play Store.
            <br>
            <br>
            The software was first announced at Google I/O in May 2013, and the first stable build was released in December 2014. Android Studio is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux desktop platforms. It replaced Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as the primary IDE for Android application development. Android Studio and the Software Development Kit can be downloaded directly from Google.
