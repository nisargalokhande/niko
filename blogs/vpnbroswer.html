            Using a VPN is a good way to secure your digital information and keep your online activity safe from prying eyes. A VPN, short for "virtual private network," encrypts the connection between your device and the internet. This encrypted connection adds an extra layer of privacy and security, which is a must-have if you ever send or receive sensitive information over the internet.

            <br>A VPN lets you connect more securely to shared Wi-Fi. It also helps you avoid data throttling by your internet service provider and increases your personal safety by making it harder for public and private entities to see your browsing and search history. A bonus is that a VPN can also help you unblock geographically restricted content online. 

            <br>However, finding the best VPN for your needs can be challenging. A flood of VPN providers has entered the marketplace over the past few years, and that's come with both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, the array of affordable VPN options now available means that -- no matter how casual or critical your privacy needs -- there's a VPN service suited to your purpose. But it also means consumers have to wade through even more VPN advertising hype. 

            <br>That's why we put each VPN through its paces with our hands-on testing and review process, which is designed to cut through the hype. We're not just examining VPNs for their technical weaknesses; we're also looking for their individual performance strengths. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN across over 20 factors and we're always improving our methodology as we learn more. 

            <br>We test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries as well as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks. By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting, or sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and its ownership in a notoriously murky market. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the uses we recommend it for most. And because we strive to keep on top of a fast-changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we learn more and retest. 

            <br>Editors' note, Feb. 9, 2022: The VPN industry has undergone significant change in the past few months, with all three of our top VPN choices announcing major changes in corporate ownership. In December, ExpressVPN announced that it had officially joined Kape Technologies, a company that already owns several other VPNs and has raised privacy concerns in the past. In February, NordVPN and Surfshark announced the companies were merging, though they'll continue to operate autonomously. We're in the process of re-evaluating all of our top picks in light of these changes. We will update our reviews and, if necessary, our rankings to account for this new competitive landscape. 

            <br>What's the best VPN in 2022?
            <br><br>ExpressVPN received a CNET Editors' Choice Award for best overall VPN. We evaluate VPNs based on their overall performance in three main categories: speed, security and price. Express isn't the cheapest, but it's among the fastest and, so far, is the most secure. (Note that we're currently re-evaluating ExpressVPN based on the news mentioned above.)
            <br>Surfshark, with its lower price, is a close second among our picks, thanks to its impressive performance and unlimited devices.
            <br>NordVPN, our third choice, is a die-hard heavy hitter. It costs more than Surfshark but less than Express, has an enormous network that's constantly getting faster and more secure and is easily the most reliable service we've tested.
            <br>What is a VPN?
            <br>A commercial virtual private network is technology that allows you to create a private connection over a less private network by creating an encrypted tunnel between your computer and the internet. You can install a VPN just like you would any other app or program on your smartphone or computer. A VPN can let you get around censorship in your country or access georestricted media content from another country -- and prevents your internet service provider from being able to intrude on your privacy by snooping on your web browsing. VPNs do this by allowing you to appear as though you're connecting from a different location or country. 

            <br>A VPN is great for anyone using public, unprotected Wi-Fi, such as what's offered in airports, bars or coffee shops. Your VPN protects your sensitive information -- from your work projects to bank account login information -- from being seen by malicious actors who trawl public Wi-Fi networks. When you browse the internet while on a VPN, your computer will contact the website through your VPN's encrypted connection. The VPN will then forward the request for you and forward the response from the website back through its secure connection.

            <br>For more beginner-focused VPN help, we've demystified some of the jargon in our guide to all the VPN terms you need to know.

            <br>The best VPN in 2022
            <br>Let's look at each of our VPN vendors below in more depth. Keep in mind that this list is constantly being updated. We're actively working on more VPN testing and research, so expect this guide to change throughout the year as we put each VPN through its paces.

            <br>The list below presents our favorites overall in 2022 so far. We'll call out when specific traits make for a better choice in a more narrow evaluation.

            <br><br>ExpressVPN
            <br>Blazing speeds, proven privacy
            <br>Number of IP addresses: 30,000
            <br>Number of servers: 3,000-plus in 160 locations
            <br>Number of simultaneous connections: 5
            <br>Country/jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands
            <br>94-plus countries
            <br>3 months free with 1-year plan, plus a free year of Backblaze cloud backup (limited-time offer)
            <br>ExpressVPN gets our Editor's Choice Award for best VPN. The VPN provider tells us its network is powered by TrustedServer technology, which ExpressVPN built to ensure that there are never any logs of users' online activities. In the privacy world, ExpressVPN has a strong track record, having experienced a server seizure by authorities which proved its zero-log policy true at the time. We also like the quality of the VPN's setup guides and the detailed information in its FAQ. 

            <br>While its speeds consistently compete with heavy-hitting competitors, our speed tests saw ExpressVPN produce a 52% overall loss of our normal internet speeds, representing a significant slowdown compared with its 2019 score of 2% speed loss. 

            <br>Like the rest of the top five VPN services we've reviewed, ExpressVPN offers a useful kill-switch feature that prevents network data from leaking outside of its secure VPN tunnel in the event the VPN connection fails. Unlike the others, though, ExpressVPN gained points from us for its support of bitcoin as a payment method -- something not all of our favorites offer, but which adds an additional layer of privacy during checkout. With a single ExpressVPN subscription, you can get VPN connectivity for every device you own -- Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, routers and more.

            <br>The company has been in business since 2009, and ExpressVPN has a substantial network of fast VPN servers spread across 94 countries. Its best plan is priced at less than $7 a month for an annual package, which includes three months free. Read our ExpressVPN review.

            <br>Surfshark
            <br>A speed leader, packed with features
            <br>Number of servers: 3,200-plus
            <br>Number of server locations: 65
            <br>Jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands
            <br>$2.30 a month (82% discount) for a 2 year plan + 2 months free
            <br>While Surfshark's network is smaller than some, the VPN service makes it up on features and speed. Let's start off with the biggest feature it offers: unlimited device support. If you want to run your entire home or office on Surfshark's VPN, you don't have to worry about how many devices you have on or connected. It also offers anti-malware, ad-blocking and tracker-blocking as part of its software.

            <br>And it's fast. With more than 3,200 servers in 65 countries, we lost less than 17% of average internet speed during our most recent speed tests. That's faster than the 27% speed loss we saw in previous tests, and pushes it ahead of ExpressVPN to be the current front-runner in our speed comparisons.

            <br>Surfshark received generally high marks when its Chrome and Firefox extensions were audited for privacy by German security firm Cure 53 (PDF link of full report) -- though that audit was commissioned by Surfshark.

            <br>The company has a solid range of app support, running on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Fire TV and routers. Additional devices such as game consoles can be configured for Surfshark via DNS settings. We particularly like the feature that allows you to whitelist certain apps and websites to automatically bypass the VPN. For some business uses, this can be critically important. 

            <br>Surfshark also offers three special modes designed for those who want to get around restrictions and more carefully hide their online footsteps. Camouflage Mode masks your VPN activity so your ISP doesn't know you're using a VPN. Multihop jumps your connection through multiple countries to hide your trail. Finally, NoBorders Mode "allows [you] to successfully use Surfshark in restrictive regions." Just be careful. Doing any of these three things could be illegal in your country and could result in severe penalties. During our testing, we didn't see a single IP address or DNS leak, and had no trouble accessing Netflix. .

            <br><br><br>NordVPN
            <br>Best VPN for reliability and security
            <br>Number of IP addresses: 5,000
            <br>Number of servers: 5,200-plus servers
            <br>Number of server locations: 62
            <br>Country/jurisdiction: Panama
            <br>62 countries
            <br>$3.29 a month for a 2-year plan
            <br>NordVPN in-depth review and hands-on testing (ZDNet)
            <br>NordVPN is one of the most recognized brands in the VPN field. It offers a generous simultaneous connection count, with six simultaneous connections through its network, where nearly all other providers offer five or fewer. NordVPN also offers a dedicated IP option, for those looking for a different level of VPN connection. NordVPN offers a kill-switch feature, and the ability to VPN into Tor. We detected no privacy leaks during our tests.

            <br>In our most recent speed tests, NordVPN's performance was on par with many of its competitors, reducing our speeds by 53% on average (which is slower than the 32% loss measured in previous speed tests). We found NordVPN's speeds were reliably fast. There were never any sudden dips or service interruptions, and where we expected the VPN to underperform, it proved itself up to the task.

            <br>The company's two-year VPN subscription plan currently costs $3.29 a month ($79 billed at once). That price is lower than most contenders, but creeps up for the one-year plan ($4.99 a month or $59 total) and the monthly plan ($11.99 a month). But it does have a full 30-day refund policy. 

            <br>While NordVPN has lived on this list for a long time, we moved it to the penalty box in October 2019 to re-evaluate our recommendation after a report emerged that one of its rented servers was accessed without authorization in 2018. Nord's actions following the discovery included -- eventually -- multiple security audits, a bug bounty program and heavier investments in server security. 

            <br>While we'd have preferred it if Nord had self-disclosed the issue much earlier, the fact that the breach was limited in nature and involved no user-identifying information served to further verify that NordVPN keeps no logs of user activity. As a result, Nord remains on this list as a recommended vendor. Read our NordVPN review.
