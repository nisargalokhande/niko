            Instagram is one of the most popular social networking apps in the market right now. Unlike Facebook, the crowd on Instagram is still young, and thus, is preferred more by most users. Instagram offers users a platoform that is versatile but still efficient and clean. Moreover, Instagram is constantly rolling out new features, which keeps things interesting. With the advent of Reels that have a much wider (and far more organic) reach, things have never looked better for content creators on the platform. With so many people flocking to Instagram for entertainment, it is not surprising that many Indian personalities have millions of followers on it. With that, we bring you the 15 most followed Indians on Instagram.
