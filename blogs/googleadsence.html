              <b>What is Google Adsense?</b>
              <br>Google Ads is a paid online advertising platform offered by Google. This is good for the advertiser because the first results on Google typically get the vast majority of the traffic for search queries.
              <br><br>However, purchasing advertising on Google doesnt necessarily ensure the top spot. After all, youll likely have a lot of other marketers competing for the same keyword through Google Ads.
              <br>
              Google Ads operates under a pay-per-click (PPC) model. That means marketers target a specific keyword on Google and make bids on the keyword  competing with others also targeting the keyword.The bids you make are maximum bids or the maximum youre willing to pay for an ad. For example, if your maximum bid is $4 and Google determines that your cost per click is $2, <br>
              then you get that ad placement! If they determine that its more than $4, you do not get the ad placement. Alternatively, you can set a maximum daily budget for your ad. <br>
              Youll never spend more than a specific amount for that ad per day, helping you get a better sense of how much you should budget for your digital ad campaign.
              Marketers have three options for their bids:<br><br>
              <br>1.Cost-per-click (CPC). How much you pay when a user clicks on your ad.
              <br>2. Cost-per-mille (CPM). How much you pay per 1000 ad impressions.
              <br>3. Cost-per-engagement (CPE). How much you pay when a user performs a specific action on your ad (signs up for a list, watch a video, etc).
              <br>Google then takes the bid amount and pairs it with an assessment of your ad called a Quality Score. According to Google:
              <br>Quality Score is an estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages. Higher quality ads can lead to lower prices and better ad positions.
              Types of Google Ads<br><br>
              1.Search campaign<br>
              2.Display campaign<br>
              3.Shopping campaign<br>
              4.Video campaign<br>
              5.App campaign<br>

              <br><br>A huge number of publishers and advertisers. As of today, over 10 million websites are using it.
              <br><br>High level of security, safety and transparency for both advertisers and publishers. This is another good feature of AdSense. Google acts as an intermediary between the two sides and is mindful of the whole process being transparent and clear for everyone. All the necessary metrics can be tracked within your Google Analytics account.
              <br><br>Variety of ad formats. In AdSense, advertisers can run text, images, HTML ads, video ads and much more, and in many different sizes. As a publisher, you can experiment with different ad types and figure out which ones drive the most revenue.
              <br><br>Tip: check which sizes are the most used by other publishers and learn from them. For example, in our own study, based on the analysis of over 63,000 advertisers and publishers, we found out that the most popular ad sizes are 728x90 and 300x250:
              <br><br>The whole process is quite simple. You create an AdSense account, insert a small amount of code into your website pages — and that’s all you need to start. Google will display targeted ads on your page that are either relevant to the content of your website or to users’ previous searches, based on its proprietary algorithms
              <br><br>Your website visitors will start clicking those ads and — the best part — you will be paid for it. Google AdSense works on a cost-per-click and revenue-sharing basis. This means that your main task will be to provide as many clicks to those ads as possible
              <br><br>Tip: do not try to cheat Google and artificially increase the number of clicks. Do not encourage your website visitors to click ads and — of course — do not click your own ads under any circumstances! Google has a very accurate and complicated system for preventing click fraud. Once it notices some suspicious activity on your website or has any doubts about the quality of your traffic and clicks, it may suspend your account.
              <br><br>Google charges advertisers per ad click. Publishers get 68% of the click amount (or 51% when it comes to AdSense for search).
              <br><br>The commission you get depends heavily on the competition and CPC in the niche. In practice, the commission per click can range from $0.20 to $15. The majority of niches bring less than $3 per click to publishers. However, there are some niches that can be extremely profitable.
              <br><br>You can see that the three most expensive niches in the US are Insurance, Online Education and Marketing & Advertising. If you are just about to start a blog and choosing the topics to cover, these numbers will be extremely useful for you.
