            <b>What is Google Ads?</b>
            <br>
            <hr>
            Google Ads is a paid online advertising platform offered by Google. This is good for the advertiser because the first results on Google typically get the vast majority of the traffic for search queries. However, purchasing advertising
             on Google doesnt necessarily ensure the top spot. After all, youll likely have a lot of other marketers competing for the same keyword through Google Ads.
             <br>
             <br>
             How Google Ads work
             <br>
             Google Ads operates under a pay-per-click (PPC) model. That means marketers target a specific keyword on Google and make bids on the keyword  competing with others also targeting the keyword.The bids you make are maximum bids or the maximum youre willing to pay for an ad.
              For example, if your maximum bid is $4 and Google determines that your cost per click is $2, then you get that ad placement! If they determine that its more than $4, you do not get the ad placement.
              Alternatively, you can set a maximum daily budget for your ad. Youll never spend more than a specific amount for that ad per day, helping you get a better sense of how much you should budget for your digital ad campaign.
              <br>
              <br>
              Marketers have three options for their bids:
              <br>
              1.Cost-per-click (CPC). How much you pay when a user clicks on your ad.
              <br>
              2. Cost-per-mille (CPM). How much you pay per 1000 ad impressions.
              <br>
              3. Cost-per-engagement (CPE). How much you pay when a user performs a specific action on your ad (signs up for a list, watch a video, etc).
              <br>
              Google then takes the bid amount and pairs it with an assessment of your ad called a Quality Score. According to Google:
              <br>
              Quality Score is an estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages. Higher quality ads can lead to lower prices and better ad positions.
