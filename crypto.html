       <p><b>What Is Cryptocurrency?</b>  
       <br>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized
        networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.
        A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
        <br> <br>
        <b>   Understanding Cryptocurrencies         </b>
        <br>
        Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system.
         "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
        <br>
        <b>Types of Cryptocurrency            </b>
        <br>The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. 
        Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto."1 As of Aug. 2021, there were over 
        18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $858.9 billion, with the figure updating frequently. Only 21 million bitcoins exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.
        <br><br>
        <b>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency</b><br>
        Advantages<br>
        Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are instead secured by the use of
        public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
        <br>
        Disadvantages<br>
        The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive governments. Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others.
        <br>
Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business online, since the forensic analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped authorities arrest and prosecute criminals.
More privacy-oriented coins do exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult to trace.
