       <p><b>Google Ads <br>           </b>
           If you’re an advertiser who wants to start capitalizing on the astronomical number of searches that take place on Google daily, 
           and quickly earn the attention you need to grow your bottom line, there’s no better way to start than by signing up to use Google Ads.<br><br>          </p>
       <p><b>What is Google Ads?            </b>  
       <br>Google Ads is Google’s online advertising program, the program allows you to create online ads to reach audiences that are interested in the products and services you offer.
        The Google Ads platform runs on pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, i.e. you have to pay every time a visitor clicks your ad.<br>
        But there are so many advertising mediums and methods out there. It can be hard to determine which is a good fit for your business. Influencers and 
        salespeople are always telling you to invest in this and invest in that without actually explaining why.
       <br><br>
       <b>1. Google’s massive reach            </b>
       <br>
       Today Google has elevated itself beyond a brand to a verb.
        The term “Google” is actually defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary
       <br>
       And that’s because, now, when people have a question that needs answering their first stop is usually Google.
       <br>
       The search engine handles an obscene 2+ trillion searches like these per year. That’s over 5 billion searches per day.
       Among those are people looking for solutions to problems that your business can offer. If they’ve ever used the internet, chances are they’ve Googled the answer to something. 
       And if you can help them find the answer, even if it’s with an ad, they’re more likely to choose you than your competitor.
       
       <br><br><b>2. Capabilities that allow for a range of targeting</b><br>
       Bidding on broad keyword search terms like “accounting software” will show your ad to prospects at the earlier stages of the product research process and allow you to fill the top of your funnel with two really simple but powerful techniques:
       <br>
       Another powerful technique for adding to your customer base is bidding on long-tail keyword search terms like “accounting software for freelance marketers.” These generally are less expensive, and they’re worth it for capturing the attention of 
       people who are looking for exactly what you offer. Most times people who search long, specific strings of keywords have more intent. And intent is what makes the people you reach on Ads so valuable (more on that next.)
